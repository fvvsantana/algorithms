# How to solve programming challenges
* Understand the problem
* Try to classify the problem: (the main part of the challenge)
    * Search for solution. (The solution is a secret)
    * Building a solution. (the solution is not a secret, the problem is to make an algorithm to create a solution.)

# For search problems:
* Uniquely represent a solution. e.g.: [rowId, colId]
* Formalize your space of search. e.g.: a matrix N*N.
* Find the brute force algorithm. (get complexity in time and space).
* Identify duplicated/non-optimized computations.
* Come with a bottom-up solution, or divide-and-conquer.
* Tips: use hash table.

# Building a solution:
* Represent the solution.
* Find the algorithm to build the solution.
* Tips: think recursively.
